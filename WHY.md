# Why I Built SyncVibes

I was tired of heavyweight feedback tools that need accounts, servers, and complex setups. 

One day, I wanted to annotate a website I was reviewing - but it wasn't mine. I couldn't install anything. That's when it hit me: what if feedback could just... exist? No backend, no sign-ups, just pure browser magic.

SyncVibes was born from that frustration. It's feedback reduced to its essence - draw a box, leave a comment, done. Whether you're testing your own site or critiquing someone else's, just paste the code in console and go.

The localStorage approach means your feedback stays with you. The tiny size means it loads instantly. The universal design means it works everywhere - React apps, static sites, even that crusty PHP site from 2010.

Sometimes the best tools are the simplest ones. SyncVibes is that tool for feedback.

*Keep the vibes in sync.* ✌️
