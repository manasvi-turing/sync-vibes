# üéµ SyncVibe
## **Why?** - *Because "can you send me a screenshot" is so last year* üéµ‚ú®

  <strong>TLDR:</strong> "Why does leaving feedback on a website feel like trying to explain a dream to someone who wasn't there?"

## The Origin Story (aka Why This Exists)

So there I was, reviewing a website my friend built. Classic scenario:

**Me:** "Dude, the button on the third section looks weird"  
**Friend:** "Which button?"  
**Me:** "The blue one"  
**Friend:** "They're all blue"  
**Me:** "The one near the... uh... thing"  
**Friend:** üòê

After 47 screenshots, 12 arrows drawn in MS Paint (yes, Paint is still alive), and one existential crisis later, I thought: 

*"What if I could just... draw a box on the screen and yell into it?"*

And thus, **SyncVibe** was born. Not from innovation, but from pure frustration and a refusal to open Figma for the 1000th time.

## What Even Is This?

It's like Post-It notes for the internet, but cooler. Click anywhere on a website, draw a box, leave a comment. Your friend imports your chaos, adds their own chaos, exports it back. Rinse, repeat, profit(?).

No servers. No databases. No "please create an account to leave feedback." Just pure, unfiltered annotation anarchy.

**Think:**
- Sticky notes, but digital and less likely to fall off your monitor
- Screenshots with arrows, but you don't need to explain what "that thing over there" means
- Comments section, but you can literally point at stuff
- That thing where you and your friend share a Google Doc, except it's ANY website

## The Vibe Check ‚ú®

```
Traditional Feedback: "The header alignment seems off"
SyncVibe Feedback: *draws box around header* "THIS. WHY IS IT SCREAMING AT ME?"
```

You can:
- ‚úÖ Draw boxes on literally anything (yes, even on other boxes)
- ‚úÖ Leave comments that actually make sense because CONTEXT
- ‚úÖ Tag your name so people know who to blame
- ‚úÖ Export everything as JSON and send it to your team (or your therapist)
- ‚úÖ Import your friend's feedback and watch chaos unfold
- ‚úÖ Works on SPAs because we're living in 2025, not 2010

## Quick Start (For the Impatient)

**Option 1: The "I Just Want It to Work" Method**
```html
<script src="syncvibe.js"></script>
<script>SyncVibe.init();</script>
```
Done. Button appears bottom-right. Click it. Go wild.

**Option 2: The "I'm a Hacker" Method**
Open any website. Press F12. Paste the console snippet. Feel powerful.

**Option 3: The "I Don't Trust You" Method**
Look at the code first. It's like 2000 lines. We're all consenting adults here.

## Current Status: Serverless Chaos üé™

Right now, everything is client-side. Your annotations live in your browser's localStorage like a digital hoarder's dream. 

To "collaborate," you export a JSON file and send it to your teammates via:
- Email (boomers love this)
- Slack (corporates love this)  
- Carrier pigeon (romantics love this)
- Blockchain (just kidding, we're not monsters)

They import it, add their comments, export it back. It's like playing hot potato, but with feedback.

**Coming Soon‚Ñ¢**: Optional backend mode for real-time sync. But the serverless chaos stays forever because some people just want to watch the world collaborate offline.

## Who Is This For?

- Designers who are tired of "make it pop"
- Developers who need to prove "the bug is LITERALLY right there"
- Product managers who want feedback that isn't just "idk feels off"
- That one friend who gives suspiciously detailed feedback at 3 AM
- Teachers annotating student work (wholesome use case!)
- Anyone who's ever said "no but like... THAT part"

## The Philosophy üßò

1. **Feedback should be visual**: Words lie, boxes don't.
2. **Collaboration shouldn't need a server**: Sometimes you just want to share a file and call it a day.
3. **Names matter**: Know who said what so you can fight about it later.
4. **Simplicity wins**: No frameworks. No dependencies. No npm packages named after philosophers.

## Installation

```bash
npm install syncvibe
# or
yarn add syncvibe
# or just download the file like it's 2005
```

Or use the CDN (once we figure out which CDN to use):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/syncvibe.min.js"></script>
```

## Quick Demo

1. Add the script to your page
2. Click the "SyncVibe" button (bottom-right, can't miss it)
3. Draw a box anywhere
4. Type your thoughts
5. Click somewhere else and draw another box
6. Realize you have 47 annotations and you've been doing this for 2 hours
7. Export ‚Üí Send to friend ‚Üí Import their file ‚Üí Repeat
8. ???
9. Profit (emotionally)

## Features Nobody Asked For But You'll Love

- **Multi-user comments**: See who said what. Blame accordingly.
- **Smart import merge**: Import your teammate's file without losing your annotations. Magic!
- **Viewport warnings**: "Hey buddy, your screen size is different. Your boxes might look wonky."
- **Hash routing support**: Works on SPAs that use # navigation (looking at you, wiki sites)
- **Comment history**: All comments on an annotation, sorted by time, attributed to humans
- **Delete button**: For when you realize your feedback was... wrong

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Escape`: Close current box (because clicking is hard)
- That's it. We believe in simplicity.

## Browser Support

Works on anything made after 2015. If you're on Internet Explorer... I'm sorry.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want a feature? 
1. Open an issue
2. Or fix it yourself and send a PR
3. Or just tell your friends about it
4. Or don't, we're not your boss

## Final Thoughts

If you made it this far, you either:
1. Actually need this tool (welcome, friend)
2. Have too much time (respect)
3. Are procrastinating (same)

Now stop reading and go annotate something. Make the internet a more feedback-able place.
