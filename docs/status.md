I'll take a look at the syncvibe.js file to understand how it handles multipage apps and SPAs.

Great question! Looking at the `syncvibe.js`, I can see an interesting situation with how it handles multipage apps and SPAs:

## Current Behavior

**What it does:**
1. **Saves all feedback to localStorage** (line 553) with each feedback including:
   - The URL (`window.location.href`) - line 470
   - The pathname (`window.location.pathname`) - line 471
   - Position coordinates (absolute pageX, pageY)

2. **On initialization** (lines 560-570), it loads ALL feedbacks from localStorage and creates markers for ALL of them - regardless of which page you're on

## The Problem

**This means right now:**
- If you add feedback on `/page1`, those markers would also appear on `/page2`, `/page3`, etc.
- All markers from all pages would show up on every page
- The markers would be at the same absolute pixel positions they were created at, which would be meaningless on different pages (pointing to wrong elements or nothing at all)

## What's Missing

To properly support multipage apps or SPAs, it would need:

1. **Page filtering** - In the `loadFeedbacks()` function, filter feedbacks by matching `feedback.pathname` or `feedback.url` against the current page
2. **Route change detection** - For SPAs, listen to URL changes (popstate, pushState, or router events) and:
   - Remove old markers
   - Reload and display only markers for the new page
3. **Smart position handling** - Could store additional context like DOM selectors or viewport-relative positions to better reconstruct marker placement

**So in short:** The widget tracks the URL with each feedback but doesn't use it to filter what's displayed. It's currently designed more for single-page scenarios rather than multi-page/multi-view applications.
